I want to take the base code for a time series AI agent from a github repository and build a react based chatbot user interface. You can help?
>>

1. Github Repository URL = https://github.com/sodafoundation-ai/ts-ai-agent
2. Make a simple GUI with provisions of Chat Query, Responses, Show a set of FAQ, Chat Session (user can add/edit the session names), provision to add a company logo, contact link, Chat bot name, description, Chatbot logo
3. Want to make it as a webapp and host locally or on a server
4. Bring up the GUI as a separate module which can be easily changed or replaced
5. Make the GUI with shades of Blue and White
6. The responses can be copied or downloaded
7. Complete chat session history can be copied or exported
8. Chat history is maintained
9. Follow up query and contexts are support
